Solution to problem 2
=============

Problem 2 consists of finding the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers that under 4000000. My solution to this was to use a while loop to go through until the current number was over 4000000. The previous Fibonacci number was stored in another variable to make finding the next number possible. The next number has to be calculated before changing any of the other numbers because otherwise, the wrong numbers would be being used.
