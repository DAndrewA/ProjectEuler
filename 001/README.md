Solution to problem 1
=============

Problem 1 involves finding the sum of all integers under 1000 that either divisible by 3 or 5. This means you need to use a for loop to go through all of the integers between 0 and 1000 and check to see if the integer MOD 3 or 5 is equal to 0. If it is, add it to the sum.
